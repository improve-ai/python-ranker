# Rank, Score & Optimize Python Data Structures

Improve AI is a machine learning platform for quickly implementing app optimization, personalization, and recommendations for [Python](https://improve.ai/python-sdk/), [iOS](https://improve.ai/ios-sdk/), and [Android](https://improve.ai/android-sdk/).

The SDKs provide simple APIs for AI [decisions]((https://improve.ai/decisions/), [ranking](https://improve.ai/ranking/), and [scoring](https://improve.ai/scoring/), that execute immediately, on-device, with zero network latency. 
Items and their rewards are with the [Improve AI Tracker / Trainer](https://github.com/improve-ai/tracker-trainer) and updated models are trained regularly for continuous learning.

## Usage

Create a list of JSON encodable items and simply call `Ranker.rank(items)`.

For instance, in a bedtime story app, you may have a list of Story dicts / objects:


```python
story = {
    "title": "<title string>",
    "author": "<author string>",
    "page_count": 123  # example integer representing number of pages for a given story
}
```

To obtain a ranked list of stories, use just one line of code:

```python
ranked_stories = Ranker(model_url).rank(stories)
```

## Reward Assignment

Easily train your rankers using [reinforcement learning](https://improve.ai/reinforcement-learning/).

First, track when an item is used:

```python
tracker = RewardTracker("stories", track_url)
reward_id = tracker.track(story, ranked_stories)
```

Later, if a positive outcome occurs, provide a reward:

```python
if purchased:
    tracker.add_reward(profit, reward_id)
```

Reinforcement learning uses positive rewards for favorable outcomes (a "carrot") and negative rewards 
for undesirable outcomes (a "stick"). By assigning rewards based on business metrics, 
such as revenue or conversions, the system optimizes these metrics over time.

## Contextual Ranking & Scoring

Improve AI turns XGBoost into a contextual multi-armed bandit, meaning that context is considered when making ranking or scoring decisions.

Often, the choice of the best variant depends on the context that the decision is made within. Let's take the example of greetings for different times of the day:

```python
greetings = ["Good Morning", 
             "Good Afternoon", 
             "Good Evening",
             "Buenos DÃ­as",
             "Buenas Tardes",
             "Buenas Noches"]
```

rank() also considers the context of each decision. The context can be any JSON-encodable data structure.

```python
ranked = ranker.rank(items=greetings, 
                     context={ "day_time": 12.0,
                               "language": "en" })
greeting = ranked[0]
```

Trained with appropriate rewards, Improve AI would learn from scratch which greeting is best for each time of day and language.
